Testing lessio
==============

Ever since we learned about it, we are huge fans of the Kawala LessIO
security manager and run our internal tests using it.

However, Wealthfront never seemed to bother releasing it to the
central maven repo. And we also had a hard time getting our patches
in.

Enter github, fork, refactor, release. Welcome to testing-lessio.

We owe Wealthfront Engineering for developing and open-sourcing such a
great tool. And we owe github for making forks that easy.
